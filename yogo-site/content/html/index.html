			<h2>Yogo: A suite of tools for making databases.</h2><br>
					
			<p>The Yogo software includes both a platform and tools that provide the infrastructure needed for scientists to do complex data management tasks with the minimum of effort. It is designed to be simple to use, powerful, and intuitive to technical users. Scientists know how to explain what data they are interested in, but typical systems don't allow them to leverage that knowledge to provide robust data models through which to collect, analyze and publish data. Yogo is designed for knowledgeable, scientific users, but it can be easily used by non-scientific users to model data, collect results, annotate data and results, and publish the collection.</p>

			<p>Yogo is entirely new code, but it is based on the lessons learned from the preceding implementation of NeuroSys. The lessons learned during writing, deploying and supporting the original software were critical to the successful design of the latest version. The new software has been divided into a few modules that, when used together, provide functionality that can't be found in other systems. These parts include: </p>
			<p><strong>The Core Data Modeling Module</strong> - the core data modeling module provides the most novel parts of the Yogo software, namely version-controlled, user-designed data types. These data types provide the foundation for building user-designed systems, and they are constructed through an intuitive web-based tool that will eventually be available for on-line or off-line use.</p>
			<p><strong>The Data Annotation Module</strong> - the data annotation module provides the ability for end users to annotate their data models and collected data. The annotations can either be free-form or selected from a given set of ontological choices specified by the principal investigator. The novel aspect of data annotation in this data annotation module is a tool to allow users to evolve free-form annotations or tags into a structured vocabulary. This tool uses statistical analysis of the tags to create suggested structures that the end user can customize and save as vocabularies.</p>
			<p><strong>The Data Publishing Module</strong> - the data publishing module provides the ability for users who have created projects with data collections to select parts of the data collection to be published online. The module provides some "semi-automated" publishing capabilities that include standard templates. However, the user can override the provided templates to provide a project specific look and feel, and the user can customize the semi-automated process, taking full control of all the options used to publish data.</p>
			<p><strong>Miscellaneous System Modules</strong> - included in the Yogo software are a set of modules that are not directly related to the functionality described in the other modules. These additional modules include user management, role-based access controls, authentication integration, automatic data collection interfaces (for interfacing to devices that produce data automatically), and storage management modules. These modules are necessary to build the platform that Yogo leverages to deliver its unique functionality, and it is in the best interest of our project to offer these modules to the broader community so they don't have to be built again.</p> 

<p>All tools created as part of the Yogo Data Management System are open source, and released under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php" title="The MIT License:Licensing | Open Source Initiative" target="_blank">MIT license</a>.</p>
