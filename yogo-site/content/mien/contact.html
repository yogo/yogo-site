			<h2>MIEN: Model Interaction Environment for Neuroscience</h2><br>
			
			<h4>MIEN Developers</h4>

      <p>To a large extent MIEN is a one man show, perpetrated by:</p>
      <div id="m-notice">
        <p style="text-align:center">Graham I Cummins</p>

        <p style="text-align:center"><a href="mailto:gic@cns.montana.edu">gic@cns.montana.edu</a></p>


          <p>I'm a postdoctoral research associate at the Center for Computational Biology, Montana State University. My website (which may have some information about MIEN or my use of it) is <a href="http://cns.montana.edu/~gic" title="Graham Cummins - CCB - MSU">here.</a></p>

        <p>Naturally, I received tremendous help from the use of other open source code. The total debt to the open source community is too long to catalog, so I must hope to pay it by releasing my own code under the GPL in hopes that I can pay it forward. The most dramatic examples are the Python language itself, the wxWidgets/wxPython project, and NumPy. Travis Oliphant, main developer for NumPy, has put so much effort towards scientific Python, including answering my own emails promptly and helping me to write Python/NumPy extensions in C, that I feel he deserves special mention (although he did not ever work directly on MIEN, and can't be blamed for its bugs).</p>

        <p>I also have a number of colleagues who help to test and apply MIEN, and are beginning to contribute to the extension blocks. I will include a more complete list of these folks soon, but for now I will mention:</p>

        <p>Gary Orser<br />
        who provides binary releases of MIEN, and contributed to the process of learning XML and applying it to scientific models.</p>
        <p>Libbey White<br />
        who has worked on documentation and the website, and is helping me with the process of making sure that someone other than me can effectively write MIEN extension blocks.</p>
