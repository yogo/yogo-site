	<h2>Designing a data form</h2>
	<br><br>
	Designing a data form takes place under the <strong>Create Form</strong> tab. <br>

	<br>

	The icons along the top represent the different types of 
	<strong>widgets</strong> that can be added to a form.<br><br>
	
	<div style="margin-left: 40px;">A widget is a data editing
	element.  Each widget has certain characteristics <br>
	which control its look and behavior during data entry.  There are two <br>
	general categories of widgets: containers and first-level widgets.  Containers <br>
	contain other widgets, either additional containers and/or first-level widgets. <br>
	This allows you to design forms with arbitrary hierarchical nesting.<br> </div>
	
	<br>
	If you click on one of the icons, that type of widget will be added to the
	form.  You can then use drag and drop to move widgets around within the form.<br>
	<br>

	<img alt="Create Form" title="Create Form"
	 src="images/Create_Form_blank.jpg"><br>
	<br>
	<br>
	To start this form, we clicked the banner widget
	icon (circled in red), and changed the label to <strong>BIRDS OF NORTH AMERICA</strong>.  <br>
	 <br>
	The other fields are created the same way.<br>

	<br>
	<img alt="Banner added" title="Banner added"
	 src="images/Create_Form_banner2.jpg"><br>
	<br>
	<br>
	At this point a text field
	widget, re-named <span style="color: rgb(51, 153, 51);font-weight: bold;">email address</span>, has just been
	added.  (By default widgets are added to the end of the
	form.)  <br>
	<br>
	You can "grab" the <span style="color: rgb(51, 153, 51);font-weight: bold;">email address</span>
	field and drag it into the <span style="color: rgb(51, 153, 51);font-weight: bold;">Contributor</span> 
	container widget, as shown below. <br>

	<br>

	When all of the desired fields have been added, saving this form
	will create a Template.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<img alt="form before drag to tree" title="form before drag to tree"
	 src="images/Create_Form_contrib1.jpg"><br>
	<br>
	<br>

	<br>
	<img alt="form after drag to tree" title="form after drag to tree"
	 src="images/Create_Form_contrib2.jpg"><br>
	<br>
	<br>

	<br> 
	<br> 
	<br> 
	<br> 

	<table BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="100%">
		<tr>
		<td align="left">
			<a href="demo.html">Previous page</A></td>	

		<td  align="center">
			<a href="form.html">Return to top of page</A></td>

		<td align="right">
			<a href="search.html">Next page</A></td>
		</tr>

	</table>
