  %h2 How do you manage scientific data?
  %p The Yogo Data Management Framework is a set of software tools created to rapidly build scientific data-management applications.  These applications will enhance the process of data annotation, analysis, and web publication.
  %p The system provides a set of easy-to-use software tools for data sharing by the scientific community. It enables researchers to build their own custom-designed data management systems. 
  %h2 Why use Yogo to manage your scientific data?
  %p The problem of scientific data management rests on several challenges.  These include flexible data storage, a way to share the stored data, tools to curate the data, and history of the data to show provenance. The Yogo Framework gives you the ability to build scientific data management applications that address all of these challenges.
  %p For more information see the #{link_to_page "Technology"} section where we go over the architecture of the system in detail.
  %h2 Who supports Yogo?
  %p The Yogo software is being developed as part of the NeuroSys project supported by the NIH NIMH, NSF EPSCoR, Michael J. Fox Foundation, Lumina Foundation, and Montana State University.
