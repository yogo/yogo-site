%h2 Yogo API's
%p 
  The YDMF exposes all of the data, schemas, projects, and users through a RESTful API that allows developers to programmatically create projects, schemas, data, and users. Users can be added to projects with the appropriate roles programmatically, ensuring authorization is enforced. Developers (or Users) using the RESTful APIâ€™s are limited to the same set of privileges they are authorized to perform from the web based user interface and are required to perform all programmatic operations using a unique API key that associates all of the programmatic activity with their user in case of failure or misuse.
