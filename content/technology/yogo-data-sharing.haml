%h2 Yogo Data Sharing

%p
  Yogo Framework applications can easily publish data to external endpoints or directly through the web-based user interface. Data that has been published through the web-based user interface can be downloaded in CSV,  YAML, XML, and JSON.  Yogo Data Sharing features enable application developers to implement tightly integrated data publishing to other services such as CUAHSI HydroServers.
