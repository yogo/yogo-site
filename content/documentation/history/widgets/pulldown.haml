%h2 Pull-down widget
#history-page
  %p
    Pull-down menus allow related, frequently re-used options to be selected with a mouse click, so users do not
    have to manually type in the text. Pre-supplied options also help
    to avoid semantic ambiguities caused by spelling, punctuation and capitalization
    inconsistencies. This is a powerful and helpful widget for encouraging and enabling the use
    of controlled vocabularies.
  %h3 Example:
  %img{:src => "/images/history/widgets/pulldown_ex.jpg"}/

  %p In the Create Form tab, click the pull-down icon in the toolbar.
  %img{:src => "/images/history/widgets/pulldown.jpg"}/

  %p A pull-down widget appears with a default label, perhaps as "PullDown1."
  %img{:src => "/images/history/widgets/pd1.jpg"}/

  %p
    Double click the default label "PullDown1."
    In the dialog box that appears, enter the new label name.
  %img{:src => "/images/history/widgets/pd3.jpg"}/

  %p Use the "New Option" choice in the pull-down to enter a new value.
  %img{:src => "/images/history/widgets/pd4.jpg"}/

  %p In the dialog box that appears, enter a new value.
  %img{:src => "/images/history/widgets/pd5.jpg"}/

  %p
    Continue adding as many new options as needed. Note, however, that you can
    add more options later, too. This can be done in either Enter Data or
    Create Form mode.
