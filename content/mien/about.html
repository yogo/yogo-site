			<h2>MIEN: Model Interaction Environment for Neuroscience</h2><br />
			
			<p>MIEN is a programming project designed to allow researchers to integrate physiological, morphological, and mathematical descriptions of biological systems into unified models. MIEN also incorporates tools for evaluation of models and data visualization.</p>

      <p>MIEN is designed for easy extension using user written blocks, and there are several projects underway to provide useful MIEN block sets.</p>

      <p>The MIEN project is still "alpha" code, but has been under development for several years and is used by the Center for Computational Biology for a variety of everyday research tasks.</p>

      <p>MIEN can operate as a replacement for anatomical viewers such as CVapp, and can provide fast interactive data visualization for researchers analyzing volumes of numerical data in Python.</p>

      <p>In addition, MIEN can convert files between a wide variety of data formats.</p>

      <p>MIEN includes tools for optimization, parameter fitting, and distributed network evaluation.</p>

      The most common uses for MIEN at the moment are the following:
      <div id="special">
        <ul>
          <li>As a viewer/editor for anatomical neural data</li>
          <li>As a viewer for time series data</li>
          <li>As a component of an interactive system for developing spike sorting protocols for neural data</li>
          <li>To provide an interface, editor, and file format support for use in integrating physiology and anatomy data into complete realistic compartmental models (these are subsequently simulated using Neuron)</li>
          <li>To implement hybrid neural models, in which abstract math models provide inputs for detailed compartmental models</li>
          <li>To develop tool chains for the sequential processing of numerical data with mathematical models, and to execute these models on networks or computing clusters</li>
          <li>To provide views of the information stored in a database</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
