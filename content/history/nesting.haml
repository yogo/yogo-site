%h2 Nesting Widgets

      %p
        The reason for nesting widgets is to provide a means
        of grouping attributes that describe an object or procedure.
        For example, the settings for a microscope on a particular data
        acquisition event may be the resolution, objective and zoom-value, or in
        the example to the right, the location having the region, state,
        county and the GPS coordinates.
      %p
        Remember that when adding new widgets, they show
        up at the bottom of the data form with the label being the name of the
        widget and a number. Double-click the name to change it.
        They can then be moved, if desired, up into one of the container
        widgets.
      %p
        NOTE: The container widgets (the tree, array screen and screen select)
        can all nest any other widget. The first-level widgets, however,
        cannot nest any other widget.
