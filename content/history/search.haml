%h2 Searching the Database
%br/
%br/
Under the
%strong Search
tab, there are two options for searching.
The first, a basic keyword search, works like Google or other search engines you may be
familiar with.
%br/
%br/
%img{:alt => "Search Tab", :src => "images/Basic_search_blank.jpg", :title => "Search Tab"}/
%br/
%br/
The
%strong Custom Search
screen is divided into two panes.
The left pane contains the data fields you are searching over.  These fields are selected
from all of the available data fields, which will be shown in the right pane.
%br/
%br/
%img{:alt => "Custom Search", :src => "images/Custom_search_1.jpg", :title => "Custom Search"}/
%br/
%br/
In order to choose the data fields you want to search over, you'll need to select
a
%strong Template
from the drop-down menu in the
right pane.  In the example below, we chose the template called "Birds_test_1."
%br/
%br/
%img{:alt => "Custom Search with template", :src => "images/Custom_search_2.jpg", :title => "Custom Search with template"}/
%br/
%br/
Now the data fields in the template on the right can be dragged over to the
"Search Terms" pane on the left.
%br/
%br/
In the example below, the fields "Contributor Name" and the bird species "Common name"
have been dragged over to the left, and the pane has been resized by sliding the
bar in the middle.
%br/
%br/
Note that the XML path that acts as a unique address for each data field appears
above it when it is dragged over to the left pane.  This helps to illustrate the power
of custom searches in NeuroSys, as the system allows the user to search values
associated with just one particular path. If this weren't the case, searching for "Name"
and "Smith" would return values for both birds and investigators whose name contained
the value "Smith."
%br/
%br/
%img{:alt => "Custom Search with two fields", :src => "images/Custom_search_two_fields.jpg", :title => "Custom Search with two fields"}/
%br/
%br/
It is now possible to enter the terms you would like to search for in the database.
If you don't remember, for instance, the contributor's name you are looking for, clicking
the
%strong Vocab
button will show you what values
exist in the database.  This is another feature that makes NeuroSys extremely useful,
especially in promoting the use of a controlled vocabulary.
%br/
%br/
Be sure to change the value "equals" to "contains" if you do not choose a value from
the vocabulary list.
%br/
%br/
%img{:alt => "Custom Search vocab", :src => "images/Custom_search_vocab.jpg", :title => "Custom Search vocab"}/
%br/
%br/
After entering the terms you wish to search for (in this example, "Kay Beckett" and "Grebe"),
clicking the
%strong Run Search
button in the lower right will
run the search and return the following dialog:
%br/
%br/
%img{:alt => "Custom Search dialog", :src => "images/Custom_search_dialog.jpg", :title => "Custom Search dialog"}/
%br/
%br/
If you click the
%strong Display
button, you will see the list
of data forms that matched your search criteria displayed under the
%strong Results
tab (shown below).
%br/
%br/
You can then select a form to open in
%strong Browse
or
%strong Enter Data
mode.
%br/
%br/
The custom search we just built can also be saved for future use.
%br/
