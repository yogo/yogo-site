	<h2> Pull-down widget</h2>

	<br>

	Pull-down menus allow related, frequently re-used options to be selected with a mouse click, so users do not
	have to manually type in the text. Pre-supplied options also help
	to avoid semantic ambiguities caused by spelling, punctuation and capitalization
	inconsistencies. This is a powerful and helpful widget for encouraging and enabling the use
	of controlled vocabularies.

	<br> <br>
	<b>Example:</b><br>
	<img src="images/pulldown_ex.jpg"><br>
	<br>



	<br>



		In the Create Form tab, click the pull-down icon in the toolbar.<br> <br>	
		<img src="images/pulldown.jpg";align="center"> <br>

		<br>
		A pull-down widget appears with a default label, perhaps as "PullDown1." <br>
		<br>

		<img src="images/pd1.jpg"><br>
		<br>

	     Double click the default label "PullDown1."
	     In the dialog box that appears, enter the new label name.
	   	 <br> <br>

	    <img src="images/pd3.jpg"><br>

	    <br>


		 Use the "New Option" choice in the pull-down to enter a new value. <br>
		 <br>

		 <img src="images/pd4.jpg"><br> 
		 <br>

		 In the dialog box that appears, enter a new value.<br>
		 <br>

		 <img src="images/pd5.jpg"><br><br>

		Continue adding as many new options as needed. Note, however, that you can 
		add more options later, too. This can be done in either Enter Data or
		Create Form mode.
