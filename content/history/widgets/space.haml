%h2 Vertical space widget
The vertical space widget provides a way to increase the amount of vertical
space between other widgets in the data form. For instance, in
the image below, there is a vertical space widget in between the text field labeled
"above" and the text field labeled "below." The vertical space widget itself is not
visible-- it simply creates the space between the other widgets.

In the Create Form tab, click on the vertical space widget icon in the toolbar.

The vertical space widget appears. It contains two buttons in a box.

Drag the vertical space widget between whichever widgets you want to separate.
Click the right arrow to expand the vertical space. Click the left arrow to
collapse the vertical space.
The vertical space widget will be invisible in Enter Data or Browse mode,
but the vertical space you created remains.
