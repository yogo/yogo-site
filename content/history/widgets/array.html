	<h2>Array screen widget</h2>

		Array screen widgets contain collections of data "screens," where each screen
		has the same organizational structure. In other words, screens in an array all 
		contain the same widgets. <br>

		<br>
		An example of this is shown below, in which each 
		screen contains information about one journal article.  So each screen has the
		same text fields to fill out. The user would add a new article by clicking the
		"Add New Screen" button, and then filling out the text fields with the new 
		information.<br><br>

		<b>Example:</b><br>	
		<img src="images/arrayscreen_ex.jpg"><br><br>

		In the Create Form tab, click on the array screen widget icon in the toolbar. <br><br>
		<img src="images/arrayscreen.jpg"><br><br>

		A new array screen widget appears with a default label.<br><br>

		<img src="images/as1.jpg"><br><br>

		Double click on the label to change it to the label you would like to use.<br><br>
		<img src="images/as2.jpg"><br><br>

		You may add whatever widgets you would like to the screen by clicking on their icons
		in the toolbar, and then dragging them into the array screen widget.  Keep in mind that 
		each widget you add will show up on every screen, in the same position and with the 
		same name. It will just be able to contain a different value.<br><br>
