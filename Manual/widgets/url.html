	<h2>URL widget</h2>

	A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a string of characters that gives the location
	of a particular resource (such as a data file or a document). Normally URL refers to
	the location of a resource on the internet, but in this application, it can also refer
	to a location in a file directory. In other words, you can use this widget to save 
	the location of important files in your own file system, and to upload those files
	into NeuroSys.<br>
	<br>

	<b>Example:</b><br>
	<img src="images/url_ex.jpg"><br>
	<br>


	In the Create Form tab, click the URL icon in the toolbar.  <br> <br>

	    <img src="images/url.jpg"><br>
	    <br>



	    A new URL widget appears with a default label.<br>
	    <br>

	    <img src="images/url1.jpg"><br><br>

	    Double click on the default label, and in the dialog box that appears, enter 
	    the label name you wish to use.<br>
	    <br>

	    <img src="images/url2.jpg"><br><br>

		The URL widget is now ready to accept data. The "Browse Server" and "Upload File"
		buttons will be used in Enter Data mode for that purpose.<br>
