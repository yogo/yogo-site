	<h2>Tabs</h2><br>

	<img src="images/tabs.jpg">
	      <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Browse</span> mode allows an inquiring 
	      investigator to see data that 
	        was acquired in a form or data collection event, but not to change that data. 
	        This information 
	        is shown in a text-based format. <br>
	        <br>
	        A form can be opened in Browse mode by either double-clicking the form name
	        or by selecting the form name and then clicking the "Open" button.  If a data 
	        file has been added to the form, a
	        clickable link will be visible, and the data file
	        can be opened by clicking the link and then choosing the appropriate application 
	        to handle the file.

	<br><br>

	      	<p>The <b>Enter Data</b> tab provides the ability to 
	        change and add information to the data forms. New forms can be also be created in 
	        Enter Data mode by selecting "New" from the File menu, and choosing a template.

	<br><br>	

			<p>The <b>Search</b> tab contains the option to do a basic keyword search, or to
			design, edit, or execute a more complex custom search.  The results of a search 
			are also displayed under the Search tab.

	<br><br>

	        <p>The <b>Create Form</b> tab contains the various tools for creating or modifying 
	        templates. These 
	       tools are divided into two groups: first-level widgets and containers. 
	        First-level widgets include the pull down, text field, url, 
	        banner, check box, list, value, date, vertical space and image 
	        <a href="glossary.html#widget">widgets</a>. 
	        The containers include the tree, array screen and screen select widgets, as shown in the figure 
	        below.
