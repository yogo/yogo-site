	<h2>Deleting and inserting widgets</h2> <br>
	
	<p>In the Create Form tab, deleting widgets can be accomplished with a 
	    	click of the right mouse button. Choose the widget you wish to delete, then click on 
	        the widget with the right mouse button. A menu will appear with a few 
	        options, including delete. Also notice that a light green box will encompass 
	        the widget that you have selected for deletion. </p>
	
	         <p><i>Note: if you select a widget that has nested widgets 
	        and delete the container widget, all of the nested widgets inside the 
	        container will also be deleted.</i></p>
	
	        <p>The option "Special: Copy and add to the bottom" creates an exact duplicate 
	        of the widget that you have selected and places it at the bottom of the 
	        data form.</p>
	
	        <p>You can also choose to insert a widget wherever you happen to be working
	        in the form, rather than the default position at the bottom of the form,
	        by using the option, "Insert Below Green Border." </p>
