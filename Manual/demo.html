	<h2>Brief Demo</h2>
	<p>
	Let's first get familiar with the NeuroSys environment, and then look at a sample 
	a entry form for entering information about birds. The data in the bird database include
	images, journal articles (PDFs), and vocalizations (WAV files), as well as
	contributor name and contact information and the states in which a bird is found. <br>

	<span style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold">The NeuroSys Environment</span>
	<br>
	The image below shows the java client window after logging in to the bird database. There
	are separate tabs for the four different ways you can interact with data: Browse,
	Enter Data, Search, and Create Form. 
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Browse</strong>
	is a read-only view of your data form. <br><br>

	<strong>Enter Data</strong> 
	allows you to change data in an existing data form.<br><br>

	<strong>Search</strong>
	allows you to query data fields in all of the existing forms.<br><br>

	<strong>Create Form</strong>
	allows you to modify the data form itself.<br>
	<br>

	By selecting (via single click) a bird name in the list, and then clicking the 
	<strong>Enter Data</strong> button at the bottom of the
	window, you will be able to view the record in data entry format, as shown here:<br>
