	<h2>Logging In</h2><br>

	<p>The internet-accessible link that points to the NeuroSys database leads, as a first step, to a login screen. 
	There the user is prompted for a name and password before actually connecting to the database. </p><br> <br> 

	<img alt="Login" title="Login"
	src="images/login.jpg"> <br>
	<br>


	The name and password combination you use must already exist in the database before 
	you can log in. If you are not currently registered, you can log in to a sample database
	with username "guest" and password "guest." 

	<br>

	<br>

	After logging in, the NeuroSys screen appears (see below). By default it opens in 
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">Browse</span> mode. Click on a folder in the left
	pane to view its contents in the right pane. <br>

	<br>
	You may also click on a single file name to view a text description of that file in the
	box below the main Browse window.
